            This RAND research report examines how governments can use artificial intelligence to support public policy 
            decisions. The authors describe how AI models analyze large datasets, such as crime statistics, health records, 
            and economic indicators, to identify patterns and predict the outcomes of different policy choices. The report 
            includes examples of AI being used to allocate resources, improve public safety, and evaluate social programs. 
            At the same time, it warns about concerns such as algorithmic bias, lack of transparency, and the need for 
            human oversight. This source is valuable because it connects technical AI tools directly to real-world policy 
            challenges and emphasizes responsible use in government settings.

            In this article, Araral explains how artificial intelligence can help governments design more effective 
            public policies. He describes how AI tools process large amounts of information about citizens, the 
            environment, and the economy to identify trends that human analysts might miss. The article gives practical 
            examples, such as using AI for traffic management, climate planning, and social welfare programs. Araral also 
            notes that AI systems can reflect existing biases if they rely on unfair or incomplete data. Because of this, 
            he argues that transparency, ethical rules, and human judgment must guide how policymakers apply AI tools. 
            The article is helpful for understanding both the promise and limits of AI in public administration.
