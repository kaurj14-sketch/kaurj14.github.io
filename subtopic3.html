            This short piece from the Council on Foreign Relations discusses how AI-powered algorithms can contribute 
            to political polarization. It explains that social media platforms use AI to keep users engaged by showing 
            content that matches their existing beliefs and emotional reactions. Over time, this can create filter bubbles 
            and echo chambers, where people are rarely exposed to opposing viewpoints. The article also touches on the role 
            of AI-generated misinformation, including deepfakes and automated accounts, in spreading divisive content. 
            Overall, the source is useful because it clearly links algorithm design to changes in political attitudes and 
            rising partisan tensions.

            This academic article looks at how artificial intelligence affects public opinion and political polarization. 
            The authors analyze how recommendation algorithms can shape which news stories and political posts users see 
            online. Their research suggests that AI systems often promote content that is more extreme or emotionally 
            charged because it generates higher engagement. At the same time, the article notes that AI could also be used 
            in positive ways, such as encouraging exposure to diverse viewpoints or detecting false information. The study 
            is important because it uses data and experiments to show that AI has a direct impact on political communication 
            and democratic debate.
