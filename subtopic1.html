            This article explains how artificial intelligence is changing the way political campaigns operate. 
            West describes how campaigns now use machine-learning tools to study voter data, including demographics, 
            online behavior, and issue interests, in order to design highly targeted messages. The piece highlights 
            how AI helps campaigns decide which voters to contact, what to say, and which communication channels to use. 
            It also discusses potential risks, such as misuse of personal data, the spread of misleading information, 
            and ethical questions about manipulating voter emotions. Overall, the article provides a clear overview of 
            both the advantages and dangers of using AI-driven tools in modern elections.

            This report from Pew Research Center explores how AI is changing political communication and voter outreach. 
            It looks at how campaigns, interest groups, and media organizations use AI tools to create targeted emails, 
            social media posts, and digital ads. The study also surveys how Americans feel about AI-generated political 
            content, including speeches and images. Many respondents express concern about transparency and trust when 
            they learn that AI has been used behind the scenes. The report is useful because it provides real data on 
            public attitudes and offers examples of how AI-generated messages can affect political engagement and voter 
            confidence in the information they receive.
